# Project Description
Verdantia is a demo website for a hypothetical company selling plant-related services. The Verdantia site is designed to appeal to creative urban millenials who value incorporating meaningful experiences into their daily lives. Verdantia offers these experiences through their curated events that let their customers bring the beauty of plants into their every day spaces. The website communicates with these target consumers through lush images of calladiums, a refined yet fun green and pink colour pallette, and site organization that allows visitors to quickly and easily learn about what Verdantia offers and how to inquire about Verdantia's services.

25 Feb 25. Fenna
- adjusted fieldsets and item order for form
[x] needs regex for phone and email
[x] needs reset button for form
[x] needs subject textarea for form - replaced with checkboxes to indicate type of inquiry
[x] would be nice to improve styling of radio buttons+labels
[x] would be nice to swap services select for checkboxes
[x] why won't the top and bottom padding for label.formField push out more space between the items? - because <label> doesn't have height+width that can be set. I added a margin-bottom value to the input fields instead
- validated all three html pages and corrected errors
[x] table needs alternating colours
[x] Use the first-letter pseudo element selector to style a first letter of (at least) one of 
your paragraphs differently. - added to footer

NICE TO HAVE:
[x] need to fix table styling to conform to design specs
[x] fix contact button at bottom of services page 
[x] fix styling of contact page to coordinate with other pages
[] adjust body/main margin+padding and child element padding for a more maintainable organization - may come back to in the future
