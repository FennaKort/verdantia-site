25 Feb 25. Fenna
- adjusted fieldsets and item order for form
[x] needs regex for phone and email
[x] needs reset button for form
[x] needs subject textarea for form - replaced with checkboxes to indicate type of inquiry
[x] would be nice to improve styling of radio buttons+labels
[x] would be nice to swap services select for checkboxes
[x] why won't the top and bottom padding for label.formField push out more space between the items? - because <label> doesn't have height+width that can be set. I added a margin-bottom value to the input fields instead
- validated all three html pages and corrected errors
[x] table needs alternating colours
[x] Use the first-letter pseudo element selector to style a first letter of (at least) one of 
your paragraphs differently. - added to footer

Remaining:
MUST:
[x] site needs logo
[] float an image to the right side of a paragraph of your choice in your website. 

NICE TO HAVE:
[] need to fix table styling to conform to design specs
[] either fix contact button at bottom of services page or remove
[] fix styling of contact page to coordinate with other pages
[] adjust body/main margin+padding and child element padding for a more maintainable organization
